# File Sorter 
Script that sorts files into folders based on their extensions.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** JavaScript, Node.Js

I used the file system module to rename the directory of the file - refering to an object containing extension names and their corresponding folders. If the extension was not present in the object, then the file is added to the Other folder.

## Lessons Learned: 

During this project I learned how to deal with node.js modules, in particular the path and fs core modules. I also learned how to create an executable sh file that runs the script through the command line.
